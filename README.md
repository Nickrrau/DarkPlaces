# DarkPlaces - Zig
This is the DarkPlaces Xotic Fork stripped of build related files and extra cruft not needed for a more tailored project.

## Current Condition
Builds on My Machine, nothing else is guaranteed. 

# Original README Header - DarkPlaces Engine

DarkPlaces is a game engine based on the Quake 1 engine by id Software. It
improves and builds upon the original 1996 engine by adding modern rendering
features, and expanding upon the engine's native game code language QuakeC, as
well as supporting additional map and model formats.

Developed by LadyHavoc. See [CREDITS](CREDITS.md) for a list of contributors.
